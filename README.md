# What we are most proud of in the assignment

We are most proud of the aesthetic of the neon galaxy we have created for the robot model.

# What we learned

We learned how to manipulate the Particle system, create a sophisticated model in Probuilder or Blender depending on what we needed and further improved our fundamentals of C# coding.

# Initial proposal:

A Star Wars esque robot that will project a hologram:
-This project will take place in a dimly lit room 
-Camera will be in the corner of the room
-We will model a robot using Probuilder
-The robot will have moving parts eg a torch that comes out of its chest
- Number keys will have different inputs to the robot such as turning on/off, projecting a hologram etc
- The hologram can be impacted by effects like light, colours and shape
- The hologram will also have an animation of it moving around
- Original music will be made.
