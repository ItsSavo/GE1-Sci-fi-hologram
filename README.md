# Description of the project

A robot is left behind in a galaxy, far, far away and needs to be rebooted.

# Instructions for use

1 - turn on the lights

Q - turn off the lights

2 - turn on robot lights

W - Turn off robot lights

3 - turn on music visuals

E - turn off music visuals



# How it works
 
 Look around the area in VR and experience the different interactions with the robot in a neon galaxy.

# What we are most proud of in the assignment

We are most proud of the aesthetic of the neon galaxy we have created for the robot model. Getting the project to smoothly run in VR with no errors as well as the amazing accidental effect that is randomly generated on the ceiling was a nice surprise.

# What we learned

We learned how to manipulate the Particle system, create a sophisticated model in Probuilder or Blender depending on what we needed and further improved our fundamentals of C# coding.

# Initial proposal:

A Star Wars esque robot that will project a hologram:
-This project will take place in a dimly lit room 
-Camera will be in the corner of the room
-We will model a robot using Probuilder
-The robot will have moving parts eg a torch that comes out of its chest
- Number keys will have different inputs to the robot such as turning on/off, projecting a hologram etc
- The hologram can be impacted by effects like light, colours and shape
- The hologram will also have an animation of it moving around
- Original music will be made.
